Linux requires that write access be given to the USB devices
in question. This is done with something call udev.

There is a config file checked in. To install it:

	$ sudo cp 10-bluelite.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
	$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

On older versions of udevadm, the option is "--reload_rules"
(note the underscore).

If the machine doesn't have udevadm, you'll need to restart
for the rules to take effect.

Last, the permission for access is granted to the "adm" group.

If your user account doesn't belong to the adm group:

	$ sudo usermod -a -G adm YOUR-USER-NAME
